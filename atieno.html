                <p>My name is Frank Agayo, and I am a fourth-year high school student at Nkaimurunya Secondary School. I have a deep passion for football and singing, and I love to travel and explore new places. Among my subjects, History is my favorite because I enjoy learning about different places and uncovering historical facts.<br><br>I come from a family of three children. My parents are separated, and I live with my mother, who works casual jobs to support us. I am the second-born, and my older sibling moved to Kisumu to find work, while my youngest sibling is in grade four. My mother does everything she can to provide for us, but it has been challenging to cover school fees and other expenses.<br><br>Receiving this scholarship would be a great relief for my mother and allow me to focus on my education without the fear of being sent home. It would also help me fulfill my dream of becoming a teacher, specializing in Kiswahili and History. I hope to study at Mount Kenya University and one day teach in international schools.<br><br>Beyond my personal goals, I hope to make a difference in my community. Many students are unable to continue their education due to financial difficulties. I want to identify those who are determined to learn and support them so they can achieve their dreams.<br><br>When I struggle with a subject, I always seek help from my friends or teachers, ensuring that I improve and stay on track.<br><br>I believe I deserve this scholarship because I am determined to change my familyâ€™s situation and create a better future for myself and those around me.<br><br>To other students facing financial struggles, I would say: Show your parents that you are determined to succeed. Let challenges be your motivation to work harder and change your situation.<br></p>
