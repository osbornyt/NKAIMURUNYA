                <p>My name is Sylvester Mecha Mugo, and I am 17 years old. I enjoy traveling, exploring new places, and playing football. At school, my favorite subjects are Mathematics, Chemistry, and History because they challenge me to think critically and understand both logical and historical perspectives. I am also the captain of my school's football team, a role that has taught me leadership, teamwork, and perseverance.

                    I come from a family of four children, and I am the third-born. Our youngest sibling was just born in September. My older brother studies at Kisumu Polytechnic, while I live with my parents. My father is a casual laborer, working in painting, and my mother washes clothes for income. She recently lost a stable job due to maternity leave, which has made it even harder for my parents to support our education.

                    Receiving this scholarship would be life-changing for me and my family. It would allow me to focus on my studies without worrying about being sent home due to unpaid fees. I want to pass my exams, make my parents proud, and set an example for my siblings. My dream is to study Computer Science at Mount Kenya University and become a system analyst and developer.

                    Beyond my own career goals, I want to give back to my community by helping talented young footballers. I plan to purchase uniforms and kits for youth teams in my area, ensuring that young players have the resources to pursue their passion.

                    To other students facing similar financial struggles, I encourage them to keep studying, even when sent home due to school fees. Challenges should not stop us from learning and striving for a better future.
