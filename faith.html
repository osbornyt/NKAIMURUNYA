                <p>My name is Faith Adhiambo. I am an introvert, but I find joy in listening to music and spending time in prayer. I also love reading, and my favorite books are crime detective stories, especially The Lost Generation.<br><br>Academically, my greatest passion lies in computer science because I am fascinated by technology and its endless possibilities. I enjoy learning how computers work and how they shape the world around us. While I am highly focused on my education, I have always wanted to join the drama club, but due to time constraints, I have been unable to participate.<br><br>I come from a family of three children and live with my single mother. My father struggled with drug addiction and is no longer part of our lives. My mother works casual jobs to provide for us, and as the last born, I have seen the challenges she faces daily to make ends meet.<br><br>Receiving this scholarship would be life-changing for me and my family. The constant fear of being sent home due to unpaid tuition fees is discouraging and often brings pessimistic thoughts. With financial stability, I would be able to focus on my studies and work even harder, knowing that my education is secure. It would also help reduce the financial burden on my mother, allowing her to focus on other essential needs for our family.<br><br>My dream is to pursue a career in Civil Aviation, with a focus on designing and engineering aircraft. I hope to study at the East African School of Aviation, where I can develop the skills to contribute to the aviation industry. Beyond my career goals, I aspire to give back to my community by helping street children and single mothers. I hope to sponsor underprivileged children in school so they can have the opportunities I once wished for.<br><br>When I struggle with a subject, I make it a priority in my revision schedule. I also turn to prayer and remain optimistic, believing that I can overcome challenges with perseverance and faith.<br><br>I strongly believe I deserve this scholarship because I am a hardworking and dedicated student who is determined to succeed. I believe that God has a plan for me, and this opportunity could be part of His path for my future.<br><br>To other students facing similar financial struggles, I would say: Believe in yourself, work hard, and love your mother. If you love your mother, you will work hard to make her proud.<br></p>
