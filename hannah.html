                <p>My name is Hannah Waithera, and I am 17 years old. I am currently in my fourth year of high school at Nkaimurunya Secondary School. I have a deep passion for art, and I enjoy drawing in my free time. Additionally, I love playing tennis, which helps me stay active and disciplined.<br><br>Academically, my favorite subject is Biology, as I find it both fascinating and easily understandable. My dream is to study Medicine at Mount Kenya University after completing high school, with the goal of becoming a dermatologist. I want to specialize in treating people with skin conditions and, one day, establish my own medical institution where I can provide expert care in skin treatment and dermatology.<br><br>I am the youngest in a family of five children, and I currently live with my mother, my sister, and her daughter. My mother is a single parent, working as a fruit vendor at the market to support our family and pay for my tuition. However, our financial situation has become even more challenging since my sister fell ill and moved in with us. With her medical expenses and the added responsibility of caring for my niece, my mother has been struggling to keep up with my school fees. There are times when I am forced to miss school while my mother searches for tuition money, which makes it difficult for me to keep up with my studies once I return. Despite these challenges, my sister constantly encourages me to stay focused on my education and not let our struggles hold me back.<br><br>Receiving this scholarship would be life-changing for me and my family. It would ease the financial burden on my mother, allowing me to remain in school without interruptions and fully focus on my studies. With this support, I will work even harder to achieve my dream of becoming the first in my family to attend university and create a better future for myself and those around me.<br></p>
