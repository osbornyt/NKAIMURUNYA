                <p>My name is Petronilla Wanjiru, and I am a self-driven and passionate student who loves writing, singing, and storytelling. I particularly enjoy writing fiction stories, as they allow me to explore my creativity and express myself.<br><br>My favorite subjects are English, History, and Chemistry because they boost my overall GPA and help me grow intellectually. Beyond academics, I have participated in athletics, specifically shot put, where I proudly competed and reached the county-level competitions.<br><br>I come from a single-parent household, where my mother supports us by selling groceries. We are three childrenâ€”my eldest sibling has completed school but is waiting for me to finish so my mother can save enough to send her to university. My youngest sibling is in grade 5.<br><br>Receiving this scholarship would be a huge relief for my family, as it would allow me to attend school regularly without financial struggles. It would also ease the burden on my mother, who works tirelessly to provide for us.<br><br>My dream is to become a therapist and study Psychology at Mount Kenya University in Thika. I want to help people realize their potential and overcome challenges. In my community, I see many people who struggle silently, and I hope to be a source of guidance and support for them.<br><br>I deserve this scholarship because I am hardworking, dedicated to my studies, and capable of achieving great things if given the opportunity. Financial difficulties should not be a barrier to education, and I am committed to making the most of this chance if awarded.<br><br>To other students facing similar challenges, my message is: Stay positive and focus on what you can do. Challenges will always exist, but they should never define your future.<br></p>
