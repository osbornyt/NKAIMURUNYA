                <p>My name is Doreen Achieng Adhiambo, and I am a dedicated student who enjoys watching romance movies, listening to music, and spending time with my family.<br><br>My favorite subjects are Agriculture, Mathematics, and History. I love Agriculture because my mom is a farmer, and we work together. Mathematics is special to me because my brother excelled in it, and he always encourages and helps me. History became one of my favorite subjects when I earned an A in my first exam in Form One, which motivated me to keep pushing myself.<br><br>In school, I participate in mathematics competitions, which challenge me to improve my problem-solving skills.<br><br>I come from a family of four children. My eldest sibling is married, my second-born sibling graduated from Jomo Kenyatta University, and my third-born sibling is currently studying at Dedan Kimathi University. My mother lives upcountry as a farmer, while I live with my father, who does welding. My parents also have financial responsibilities supporting their siblings and cousins, which makes affording my education difficult.<br><br>Receiving this scholarship would make a significant difference in my life by improving my school attendance and helping me achieve better grades. It would also ease my parentsâ€™ financial burden and allow them to continue supporting our extended family.<br><br>I have always dreamed of becoming a journalist, but my father, who once wanted to be a teacher but could not afford to pursue it, inspired me to follow in his footsteps. I now aspire to be a high school teacher specializing in Agriculture and Biology, fulfilling his dream while also pursuing my passion. I hope to study at Kenyatta University.<br><br>In the future, I want to improve the living standards of my family by building them a house and supporting my younger cousins. I believe that education is the key to breaking financial struggles, and I am determined to make a difference.<br><br>To students facing similar financial challenges, my message is: Never give up. Even when I am sent home for school fees, I continue working hard so that one day, my children will not have to experience the same struggles.<br></p>
