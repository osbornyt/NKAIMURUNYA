                <p>My name is Ngadi Faith Andisa, and I am a determined and hardworking student with a passion for netball, cooking, and sewing. I enjoy using my hands creatively and take pride in learning new skills.<br><br>My favorite subjects are Biology, Home Science, and English. I love Biology because I understand it easily, and Home Science allows me to express my creativity through cooking and sewing. English helps me communicate effectively and express my thoughts clearly.<br><br>I have actively participated in extracurricular activities, representing Kajiado North in netball since Form One. I play as a GK and have grown to love the sport and the teamwork it fosters.<br><br>I come from a family of five, and I am the third-born. My father is not present, and my mother works as a casual laborer to support us. My older brothers do not have stable jobs, and my younger siblings are still in school. My mother struggles to pay my school fees, and I am often sent home, which affects my education.<br><br>Receiving this scholarship would be life-changing. It would improve my school attendance, help me focus on my academics—especially Mathematics—and reduce the financial burden on my mother. With this support, I will work even harder to pursue my dreams and support my family.<br><br>I aspire to become a lawyer because I believe in defending the less fortunate. Too often, people take advantage of those who are struggling, and I want to fight for justice in my community. I hope to study at Kenyatta University and use my education to make a difference.<br><br>In the future, my goal is to support my mother so she does not have to work so hard. She is my greatest inspiration, and I want to give back to her and to my community.<br><br>When I face academic challenges, I turn to my mother for encouragement—she is my everything. Even when I am sent home for school fees, I borrow books from neighbors and continue studying on my own. I never stop learning, no matter the circumstances.<br><br>To other students facing financial struggles, I want to say: Never stop believing in yourself. Even if you are sent home, keep studying. Your education is your future, and no challenge should take that away from you.<br></p>
